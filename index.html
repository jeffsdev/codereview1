    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Greetings, weary traveler! I'm a geeky coffee-drinking 26 year old from Portland who loves tech, <strong>gaming</strong>, digital art, and music.  I graduated from Pacific University a few years ago, where I studied Philosophy and Economics. Since then, I've been working and doing the usual adult thing. This last year, after much introspecion, I realized I wanted to change my career into something that falls in line with the things that I've had a passion for my whole life - <em>computers</em> and <em>technology</em>. I've always wanted to learn programming. It's exciting and <strong>fun</strong>!</p>
